# Prism Workspace for TypeScript

TypeScript implementation of Prism's guarded agent workspace. It provides a
Promise-based local workspace, stable owner addressing, optional authorization,
streamed directory listings, stable failure codes, lexical path guarding, and
realpath-based symlink containment.

The package ships the same byte-preserving 134-case adversarial corpus as PHP.
Tests run every case and create real links both into and out of the workspace.
Workspace contents are never executed.

This package is private while coordinated parity work is in progress.
